--1.	Retrieve customer orders
o	As an initial step towards generating the invoice report, write a query that returns the company name from the SalesLT.Customer table, and the sales order ID 
and total due from the SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table
THE_CODE:-
SELECT C.CompanyName,O.SalesOrderID, O.TotalDue
FROM [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[Customer] AS C 
JOIN [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[SalesOrderHeader] AS O 
  ON C.CustomerID= O.CustomerID

--2.	Retrieve customer orders with addresses
o	Extend your customer orders query to include the Main Office address for each customer, including the full street address, city, 
state or province, postal code, and country or region

THE CODE:-
SELECT C.CompanyName,
       O.SalesOrderID, 
       O.TotalDue, 
       A.AddressLine1,
       ISNULL(A.AddressLine2,'') AS AddressLine_2,
       A.City,
       A.StateProvince,
       A.CountryRegion,
       A.PostalCode, 
       CA.AddressType
FROM [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[Customer] AS C 
JOIN [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[SalesOrderHeader] AS O 
  ON C.CustomerID= O.CustomerID
JOIN [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[CustomerAddress] AS CA 
  ON C.CustomerID= CA.CustomerID 
JOIN [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[Address] AS A 
  ON O.ShipToAddressID = A.AddressID
WHERE CA.AddressType = 'Main Office'

--3 1.	Retrieve a list of all customers and their orders
o	The sales manager wants a list of all customer companies and their contacts (first name and last name), showing the sales order ID 
and total due for each order they have placed. Customers who have not placed any orders 
should be included at the bottom of the list with NULL values for the order ID and total due.

THE CODE:-
SELECT C.CompanyName,C.FirstName,C.LastName,O.SalesOrderID, O.TotalDue
FROM [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[Customer] AS C 
LEFT JOIN [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[SalesOrderHeader] AS O 
  ON C.CustomerID= O.CustomerID
ORDER BY o.SalesOrderID DESC, o.TotalDue DESC 

--4- 2.	Retrieve a list of customers with no address
o	A sales employee has noticed that Adventure Works does not have address information for all customers.
You must write a query that returns a list of customer IDs, company names, contact names (first name and last name), 
and phone numbers for customers with no address stored in the database.
 
THE CODE:-
SELECT c.CustomerID,C.CompanyName, C.FirstName+' '+C.LastName AS ContactName ,
       C.Phone , CA.AddressID 
FROM [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[Customer] AS C 
LEFT JOIN  [adventureworks].[SalesLT].[CustomerAddress] AS CA
  ON C.CustomerID = CA.CustomerID
WHERE CA.AddressID IS NULL 

--5- The marketing team has asked you to retrieve data for a new product catalog.
1.	Retrieve product information by category
o	The product catalog will list products by parent category and subcategory, so you must write a query that retrieves the parent category name, 
subcategory name, and product name fields for the catalog.

THE CODE:-
SELECT pcat.Name AS ParentCategory, cat.Name AS SubCategory, prd.Name AS ProductName
FROM SalesLT.ProductCategory pcat
JOIN SalesLT.ProductCategory as cat
    ON pcat.ProductCategoryID = cat.ParentProductCategoryID
JOIN SalesLT.Product as prd
    ON prd.ProductCategoryID = cat.ProductCategoryID
ORDER BY ParentCategory, SubCategory, ProductName;
